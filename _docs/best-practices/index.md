## [Naming Conventions](/infantree-dev-docs/docs/best-practices/naming-conventions)

## Browser Support

We support as many browsers as possible, but cannot deliver the same experience to all browsers. Site must at least be readable to all browsers but do not need to look or function to the same degree.

As a general rule, Infantree supports browsers that have been updated within the last year. We can make a call on a project- or client-basis if analytics data provides details about visitor browsing habits that break from this rule. If we need to build for browsers that we do not typically support, we can charge an fee to account for the additional time and effort.

## Accessibility

Levels of accessibility we can provide
1 Bare minimum: AA
2 AA, but for sites with features that need extra attention
3 AAA, or very difficult/techincal features
